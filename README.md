# Laser-plasma-acceleration tools (LPA-TOOLS)

## SHORT DESCRIPTION: 

This repository includes a bunch of simple tools for simulations of laser-plasma-acceleration, especially ionization-induced trapping in laser-plasma-accelerators.

## FEATURES:

This is a short overview of the features that are included in this repository. See the README file in the respective folder for more detailed information, there are also examples.

### Tunnel ionization probability (TIP):

For ionization-induced trapping in laser-plasma-accelerators it is useful to know, what kind of gas (i.e. nitrogen, argon or krypton) will be ionized at which laser amplitude and what the corresponding initial energy of the ionized electrons is. 

This tool plots the tunneling ionization probability in dependence of the initial electron energy or/and the laser amplitude.

### Plasma density analysis (PDA):

To get the best results in laser-plasma-acceleration, the plateau of the plasma density for post acceleration should be smooth, even if you dope the hydrogen gas temporarily with a small amount of a high-Z gas (for example nitrogen). 

This tool plots the total gas density, the nitrogen gas density and the hydrogen gas density that are needed for a smooth plasma density plateau.

## Requirements:

All tools are python scripts, so you should've installed a python distribution, for example Anaconda, see https://www.anaconda.com/download/
