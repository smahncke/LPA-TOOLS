# Laser-plasma-acceleration tools (LPA-TOOLS)

## Tunnel ionization tools

### DESCRIPTION:

Tunnel ionization is an important process if you're working with ionization-induced trapping laser plasma accelerators. The following scripts should help to understand those processes better.

### REQUIREMENTS:

- A python distribution should be installed to run the code (i.e. Anaconda, see https://docs.anaconda.com/)

### FEATURES:

- Probability: The probability script plots the ionization probability of choosable gases in dependence of different parameters, like the 
               initial electron energy after ionization or the peak of the laser amplitude.
               
- Degree:      The ionization degree script gives the total degree of ionization if a gaussian laser pulse hits a gas. 

See the readme files in the corresponding folders for further information.
