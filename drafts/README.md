# Plasma density analysis (PDA)

# DRAFTS

In this folder the source files and drafts of the project will be saved. 

# Draft 1 & 2:

(OUT OF DATE)

# Draft 3:

- The basic structure has been improved.
- KNOWN ISSUES: The electron density test function fails -> There is an issue in calculating the H2 gas density function.

# Draft 4:

- The way the total gas density will be calculated has been improved -> The results of the test functions are positive now
